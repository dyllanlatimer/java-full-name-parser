# java-full-name-parser
Java library to parse a full name into its parts.

## About
The purpose of this project is to provide a library capable of parsing a full name into all of its parts. 

For example, "Bob Smith" would return a first name of "Bob" and last name of "Smith". This workflow becomes more complicated and tedious the more in depth and excessive the handling needs to become.

I had looked for other projects that suited my needs, but the closest one I found was a javascript library...

I plan on maintaining this library and optimizing it and adding a few features to make it a bit more verstile.
